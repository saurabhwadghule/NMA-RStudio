# 📊 Network Meta-Analysis in R: Master's Thesis Project

## 📝 About This Project  
This repository contains R scripts for the statistical analysis of my Master's Thesis, where I conducted a Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) using the netmeta package in R.

What is Network Meta-Analysis (NMA)?
Network Meta-Analysis (NMA) is an advanced statistical method that allows for the comparison of multiple treatment options, even when they have not been directly compared in head-to-head trials. By integrating direct and indirect evidence from different studies, NMA provides a comprehensive ranking of treatments based on their effectiveness. This approach is particularly useful when multiple interventions exist, but limited direct comparisons are available.

Why Use NMA?
Leverages indirect evidence to strengthen conclusions
Ranks treatments based on their comparative effectiveness
Provides a holistic view of available interventions
Analysis Process
The analysis was performed using data extracted from published studies, compiled in an Excel file. These data were processed in R using the netmeta package to generate:

Forest plots 📉 – for visualizing treatment comparisons
Network plots 🔗 – to illustrate treatment connections
Ranking probability plots 🏆 – to determine the best treatment option
This repository contains all scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis, making it a useful reference for researchers conducting similar studies.
